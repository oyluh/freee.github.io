    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Q: How long did you make all of this?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>
        A: I made this from May 23 to May 25. (yes I crammed my way here) I'm not sure with the total hours of work but it really took
        time because I'm not that knowledgeable on this programming language :c and everything was just made on the spot.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="faq">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Q: How did you make it?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>
        A: I used the programming languages HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript with the help of my dear friend ChatGPT. :D
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="faq">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Q: Are you nervous/worried during the time you're working on it?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>
        A: Definitely yes! I was really worried that I won't be able to finish it because I only know the basics of HTML and CSS and
        literally zero knowledge with JavaScript that's why I'm so lucky to have ChatGPT as my companion while making it, it really 
        helped me a lot! :<
      </p>

  <div class="faq">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Q: Did you plan all of this ahead of time?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>
        A: Definitely not, I wasn't really prepared and did this the last minute. It was just a sudden idea and I think everything was
        just according to plan because it's the same week I started to plan and want to study some programming languages and had just 
        reset my Laptop so I can use my Visual Studio Code as my IDE.

  <div class="faq">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Q: Were all your ideas and goals achieved in this project?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>
        A: No :( I really wanted it to be strawberry themed but I lack the skills and knowledge and just gave up midway on 
        creating one, I tried! :( so I adjusted and just picked your favorite color green and the color of your favorite flower 
        lavender as the color theme. Also, the buttons were referenced after the color of strawberries which is red! and to add to my
        already long answer, I actually had a lot of ideas I wanted to add but due to my lack of skills I wasn't able to do it :-: 
        maybe next time!
      </p>

  <div class="faq">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Q: Did you have a hard time creating this?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>
        A: Yes and No, yes it was really hard because I was running out of ideas and it was really hard to debug the code sometimes 
        and to come up with solutions or adjustments that will make the code work, and no because I really had fun creating this not 
        only because this is for my love but also because I learned something out of creating it and it was a great experience! 
      </p>

  <div class="faq">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Q: Are you excited to show this to your love?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>
        A: Yes! I was so excited to show it to my love and see her reaction even when I was still in the middle of making it :-: that's 
        how excited I am hehe. I'm terrible at hiding surprises and I nearly exposed myself to you during the time of creation, haixt.

  <div class="faq">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Q: What part of the project do you like the most?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>
        A: The FAQ's and the letter part! because I've expressed and just became myself as I inputted everything in these two sections.
        And... I loved talking here.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Q: Will you give up your love when your favorite celebrity/idol asks
    you out?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>
        A: No! even if it's Jennie, Nayeon, Ikura, Wonyoung, Chaewon, Lily, Minji, Koga, etc. I won't exchange and give up my love for
        my riri, for real! because my relationship and connection with her cannot be compared and matched by these people. And I wish
        to marry my love and love her for a lifetime, there's no if's, but's, or any other third parties, never !!!
      </p>

  <div class="faq">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Q: Are these F.A.Q's. real? Or did you just made them up?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>
        A: Oh you know me well, I just made this all up and these questions are really questions that came from myself :p cmon I really
        enjoyed asking myself and answering myself here, it's fun to read isn't it?
      </p>
    </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Q: Can you explain everything in this program? It's hard to navigate and 
      confusing.</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>
        A: I'm really sorry if it looks ugly or it's hard to navigate, I'm a beginner, I'm sorry!!! I tried my best to make it look
        decent as much as possible with the time available and this was all I can do. Anyway, the first page has 7 clickable buttons
        namely 1, 2, 3, Bebi, 4, F.A.Q's., and 6. Each button redirects to another page or link and there are different gimmicks on
        each of the pages. The first button (1) is just a rickroll and it links you to a YouTube video, sorry for rickrolling you hehe.
        The second button (2) is just an alert that says "I love you so much!", it's just a silly reminder that I love you! The third
        button (3) is a small boring game that I made and it's just a 3-question quiz that asks about the important dates in our
        relationship, there's no consequence if you get it wrong so just play it, but it's really pointless to be honest. The fourth
        button (4) is a reminders page just to remind you how I adore and appreciate your existence, just a small reeminder you know.
        The fifth button (F.A.Q's.) from the name itself is a F.A.Q page where I made some questions and answered it myself for your own
        entertainment, I REALLY HOPE YOU'RE ENTERTAINED WITH THIS, if not then please forgive me because I love this part a lot! The
        sixth button (6) is a silly pick-up line page where I just shame myself for putting some corny lines there for your
        entertainment, please smile or laugh just a little. :c and last but not the least the middle button (Bebi) is where my letter
        for you is located, this is typewreeten and I hope you appreciate it even if it's digital! I love you so much <8
